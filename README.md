# fnt
apt for fonts, the missing font manager for macOS/linux

# Why?

If you run [Debian](www.debian.org) stable, you don't get the latest fonts, unless someone backports them actively. So this is useful to just get the latest and greates fonts from Debian sid. It gets even worse with non Debian based Linux distributions.

If you run macOS, neither fink, brew, nore macports come with a great list of available to install fonts.

# Missing a font?

Feel free to create an issue, if the font comes with sources and its license is DFSG compliant, I'm happy to package it for a dollar. Free if I like it.

# TODO

Get ReactOS with bash, and make fnt work there.
